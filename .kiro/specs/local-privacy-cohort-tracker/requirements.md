# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Local Privacy Cohort Tracker is a privacy-respecting, cohort-based tracking system that operates entirely on the user's local device, replacing third-party cookies. This system aligns with Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, enabling interest-based advertising while ensuring user data remains private and secure. The solution will analyze browsing history locally to assign users to interest-based cohorts, provide user controls for privacy management, and offer APIs for advertisers to target ads without accessing individual user data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web user, I want my browsing history to be analyzed locally to assign me to relevant interest cohorts, so that I can receive targeted content while maintaining my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a website THEN the system SHALL analyze the domain locally and assign it to appropriate topic categories from a taxonomy of ~469 topics
2. WHEN cohort assignment occurs THEN the system SHALL process all data on the user's device without sending any individual browsing data to external servers
3. WHEN weekly cohort updates run THEN the system SHALL select the top 5 topics based on visit frequency and share only 3 topics (one per week for three weeks)
4. WHEN storing cohort data THEN the system SHALL retain cohort assignments for a maximum of three weeks
5. IF a website domain is not in the predefined mapping THEN the system SHALL use keyword matching as a fallback method to categorize the domain

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web user, I want full transparency and control over my cohort assignments, so that I can manage my privacy preferences effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses privacy controls THEN the system SHALL display all current cohort assignments with clear explanations
2. WHEN a user wants to modify cohorts THEN the system SHALL allow removal or disabling of specific cohort assignments
3. WHEN a user disables cohorts THEN the system SHALL stop all cohort-based processing and data sharing
4. WHEN displaying cohort information THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of how cohorts are used and what data is processed
5. WHEN user consent is required THEN the system SHALL implement GDPR and CCPA compliant consent mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an advertiser, I want to target ads based on cohort IDs without accessing individual user data, so that I can deliver relevant advertising while respecting user privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an advertiser queries for cohort data THEN the system SHALL provide only anonymized cohort IDs without any individual user information
2. WHEN cohort IDs are shared THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with existing ad tech stacks using FLEDGE-like mechanisms
3. WHEN advertisers access the API THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize requests securely
4. WHEN cohort data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time cohort assignments for the current user session
5. IF a user has disabled cohorts THEN the system SHALL return no cohort data to advertisers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want privacy-preserving measurement of ad performance based on cohort data, so that I can optimize my content and ad revenue while respecting user privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring ad performance THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated metrics like impressions and click-through rates by cohort
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL ensure all data is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual users
3. WHEN attribution reporting occurs THEN the system SHALL align with Attribution Reporting API principles for aggregated reporting
4. WHEN publishers request metrics THEN the system SHALL provide cohort-based performance data without exposing individual user behavior
5. IF insufficient data exists for a cohort THEN the system SHALL suppress reporting to prevent user identification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cross-platform compatibility for the cohort tracker, so that I can integrate it across different browsers and mobile platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed as a browser extension THEN the system SHALL support Chrome, Firefox, and Safari using WebExtensions API
2. WHEN deployed on mobile THEN the system SHALL support both Android and iOS platforms
3. WHEN storing data on browsers THEN the system SHALL use `chrome.storage` or `browser.storage` for secure local storage
4. WHEN storing data on mobile THEN the system SHALL use platform-specific secure storage (Android EncryptedSharedPreferences, iOS Keychain)
5. WHEN processing cohorts THEN the system SHALL maintain minimal impact on device performance across all platforms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security and privacy protections for all cohort data, so that user information remains protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing any cohort-related data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data using industry-standard encryption methods
2. WHEN processing occurs THEN the system SHALL isolate cohort data to prevent unauthorized access by other applications
3. WHEN data retention periods expire THEN the system SHALL automatically delete expired cohort assignments
4. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL ensure no individual browsing data is transmitted to external servers
5. IF a security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately isolate and protect remaining data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to adhere to privacy regulations, so that our organization meets legal requirements for data protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing personal data THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR requirements including user consent and data subject rights
2. WHEN operating in California THEN the system SHALL comply with CCPA requirements for consumer privacy rights
3. WHEN sensitive categories are encountered THEN the system SHALL exclude topics related to race, religion, sexual orientation, and other protected categories
4. WHEN users exercise their rights THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for data access, correction, and deletion
5. WHEN consent is withdrawn THEN the system SHALL immediately stop processing and delete all related data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing and validation capabilities, so that I can ensure the system works correctly across all supported platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing cohort assignment THEN the system SHALL provide debugging capabilities to validate assignment accuracy
2. WHEN testing across platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent behavior on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Android, and iOS
3. WHEN validating privacy THEN the system SHALL provide tools to verify that no individual data is exposed
4. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL demonstrate minimal impact on device resources
5. WHEN integration testing THEN the system SHALL validate API functionality with mock advertiser and publisher systems
